Hi, my name is Daniel Tuttle. I’m a software engineer and I’ve been working in the field for about 4 years. I decided to create this blog to write about the things that I learn. I have found that writing about a topic I’m currently learning is a good way to get a deeper understanding, and since English is not my native language, it helps me improve my English skills too.

Hopefully you would find some value in my posts, and any feedback would be appreciated!!
