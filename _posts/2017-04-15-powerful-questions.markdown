One thing that I'm doing lately every time I read a book, is to take some notes of the salient points and store them in a private repository. These notes help me every time I forget something that I read previously.

Now, I want to try something different. Instead of keeping these notes to myself, I'm going to create a blog post with the concepts/ideas that captured my attention while reading a book.

Let's begin!

<!--description-->

The book that I'm currently reading is [Patterns, Principles, and Practices of Domain-Driven Design](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Patterns-Principles-and-Practices-of-Domain-Driven-Design.productCd-1118714709.html){:target="_blank"}. One of the tips the authors mention that will help you during knowledge-crunching sessions, is to ask powerful questions. So, the idea of this post is to create a list of questions that will help us get valuable information from the domain experts.

The following questions are taken from the book:

> Where does the need of this system come from?

> How will this system give value to the business?

> What would happen if this system wasn’t built?

> What is the business trying to achieve?

> What is the success criteria of this product?

> What will make it a worthwhile endeavor?

> What does good look like?

> Why the software is being written rather than opting for a commercial off‐the‐shelf product?

> How will building an application make a difference to the business?

> How does it fit within the strategy of the company?

> Why is it being built in‐house rather than being outsourced?

> Does part of the software give the business a competitive edge?

The book mentions a blog post with [Powerful Questions](https://goodenoughsoftware.net/2012/02/29/powerful-questions/){:target="_blank"} as well. Make sure you read the comments section!
